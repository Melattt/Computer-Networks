### Basic guides.

1. Navigate to the directory where the TFTPSERVER is located. This can be done using the command line or file explorer, depending on your operating system.

2. Start the server by running the command java TFTPSERVER.java in the command line. This assumes that you have Java installed on your system and that the TFTPSERVER file is compiled and ready to run.

3. Once the server is running, a message will be displayed in the terminal indicating that the server is listening at port 4970 for new requests. This means that the server is ready to receive and respond to client requests.

4. Open the TFTP client application on your machine. This can be done by downloading and installing a TFTP client application or by using the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system.

5. Configure the TFTP client application for get and put operations. This typically involves specifying the server IP address and port number, as well as the file name and transfer mode (e.g., binary or ASCII). The specific steps for configuring the client application will depend on the application being used.

6. Once the client is configured, initiate a get or put operation by selecting the appropriate option in the client application. This will typically involve specifying the file name and destination directory for the transfer.

7. The TFTP client and server will then exchange packets to transfer the file. If the transfer is successful, the file will be available in the specified destination directory on the client machine.
